# County_Voter_Reg
This project is still in progress.

Project goals are to build a map-based interactive dashboard that allows users to explore voter registration statistics for each county in NJ. Builds upon (and will eventually replace) an old repository that examined data at the congressional district level in 2016 and 2020, and examined the impact of COVID on new registrations.
